# FPL Dashboard

**FPL Dashboard** is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that helps Fantasy Premier League (FPL) players analyze player performance and upcoming fixtures to make smarter team selection decisions.

The dashboard pulls real-time data directly from the official FPL API and presents it through dynamic tables, visualizations, and filtersâ€”providing insights into player form, team fixtures, and key performance metrics.

*This project is a work-in-progress and aims to evolve into a comprehensive tool for FPL managers.*
